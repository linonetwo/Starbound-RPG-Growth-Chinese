Of course, there were times when bandits tried to stake claim, or perhaps a local fight broke out in a town on one of the lusher planets. Besides that, however, peaceful.\n\nIt hadn't always been that way: back then, there were ferocious monsters and ruthless pirates about. But the light that they brought with them was brighter than that, and with it came rapid growth and new settlements. Tenre said it was because of that man and his wife: the Paladin and the Valkyrie; Sen and Mellou. A pair that even the fearless feared, devout in their belief and kind in their creed. With the magic they used, even plants could grow in the roughest of conditions, and the Sector was without a doubt, tamed... Or so it was said.\n\nTenre was rather joyful, of course, as any Pioneer would be: rough conditions meant better resources, as was common for most planets. He hadn't asked them to come along for nothing either: the pirates in the sector had made it quite clear that no one would be passing through, and as one of the leading commanders in Winter's rather large coalition -- greater in size to even the Protectorate -- Sen would gladly remove their presence from the Sector.\n\nAnd thus, with Tenre's guidance, and Sen and Mellou's rather impressive intervention, the Sector came to be what it was, again, for quite some time.\n\nBlack. Suddenly. Intensely. A 'fog' seemingly removed Sector I5-T from radar, but it was there. Probably. They say 'probably' because it wasn't possible to enter, but not because of some sort of barricade: no, just... not possible. Nothing came out, nothing came in: a whole sector, gone. Egoen, the master Warlock, recognized universally as the most intelligent Wizard (and in that case, being), studied it for quite some time and came to quite a rather shocking conclusion: \"If, by chance, anything or anyone were still alive within the darkness,\" he said, \"they would be dead. Unfortunate,\" he said, almost matter of fact, \"because Sen was patrolling that region: a menial task, of course, for someone of his caliber, but one he insisted must be done by everyone regardless of their status. What a waste.\" And with that, the Sector and its nearest surroundings were quarantined and abandoned, leaving only the brave to venture near...\n\nWhite. Suddenly. Intensely. Years had passed, and while the 'darkness' did not spread, it had not vanished; but just like that, one spark, and the entire Sector reappeared. Cautiously explored, nothing remained: not a shred of life, not a planet nor sun nor spec of debree, not a single thing... Except one chunk of a seemingly gold shuttle with blue highlights, a message within -- Sen's message -- and a barely dented magnificent shield floating, undisturbed, as if it had just been held not moments before.",

But it gave her cover from the howling winds, pounding rain into the metal. She heard every drop. Flames lighting up the darkness, with occasional flashes from lightning outside, she cooked the beast, salivating. Another night.\n\nMorning came and she woke calmly, nudged gently by someone familiar. Normally, she would have noticed a presence much sooner, knife brandished, but with the Floran in front of her, it was rather difficult. The Floran smirked, before offering up a canteen. The nectarine water relieved her parched throat. Another morning.\n\nThe two continued along a tangled path, relying on her ears and eyes for guidance. Approaching the unknown entrance, they stopped to investigate - and summarily dismantle - the various contraptions meant to brutally dismember intruders. With the two of them quite astute and dextrous, it was child's play. The Ancient Tomb now exposed forever, the two searched inside, longing for an answer. Despite the Floran's perfect translations, the text was seemingly nonsensical, but not quite. Another clue.\n\nNow back in vicious wilderness, the two took shelter once more. Despite the situation, the Floran's hand grazed her neck. \"Will you help me recharge?\" The Floran teased: her actions set the context. \"Ha!\" The Hunter giggled. \"That's just like you. All alone for only three days and you're already like this.\" Even so, she reciprocated: Hunter or not, a little levity never hurt. Another day... a peaceful day.",
